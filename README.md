This program implements D-Stepping algorithm introduced by U.Mayers and P.Sanders [1], using SSSP algorith for faster execution[2].
Algorith can be found in link:
  https://cs.iupui.edu/~fgsong/LearnHPC/sssp/deltaStep.html
Graph is read from an input file created by RandomGraph generator by S.Pettie and V.Ramachandran, provided in link:
  http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/challenge9/code/Randgraph.tar.gz
Finding shortest path distance for each node occurs in parallel, by using the MPI Standard.
Execution command:
mpiexec -np {number_of_cores} {executable} {d_step} {input_file} {output_file}
Execution example:
