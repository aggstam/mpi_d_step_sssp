This program implements D-Stepping algorithm introduced by U.Mayers and P.Sanders [1], using SSSP algorith for faster execution[2].
<br>
Algorith can be found in link:

<br>
Graph is read from an input file created by RandomGraph generator by S.Pettie and V.Ramachandran, provided in link:

<br>
Finding shortest path distance for each node occurs in parallel, by using the MPI Standard.

<br>
Execution command:
<br>
mpiexec -np {number_of_cores} {executable} {d_step} {input_file} {output_file}
<br>
