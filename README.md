# mpi_d_step_sssp
This program implements D-Stepping algorithm introduced by U.Mayers and P.Sanders [1], using SSSP algorith for faster execution [2].
<br>
A graphical presentation of the algorith can be found in link:

  https://cs.iupui.edu/~fgsong/LearnHPC/sssp/deltaStep.html
<br>
Graph is read from an input file created by RandomGraph generator by S.Pettie and V.Ramachandran [3].
<br>
Two implementations are included, one executing the algorithm in serial, and one using the MPI Standard.
